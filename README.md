# LibreOffice-Base-Examples
Examples to show how to build things in LibreOffice Base database tool


**Pull downs.odb** - This shows a simple form with pull down field selectors each based on another table.  Pretty basic stuff.

**Lookup.odb** - This shows a method I worked out to easily allow multiple pull down record selectors like I have used for so many years in many other data bases, but for some reason which is missing in LO.  More advanced and uses macros.
